# Floorplan - Create (Multi-Stepper)

## Create an initial Business Object

Standardized process for creating a new business object within a static, linear stepper, initiated from the table-based overview page.

### Overview Page with Table

The overview page displays all existing business objects in a table and serves as the entry point for the create flow. The primary action “Create / New Business Object” starts the creation process; this action is placed consistently and is clearly identified as the trigger for initial creation.

      thumbStyle={{ width: '100%', marginTop: 8 }}
      lightboxPaddingY={72}
    />
  

### Detail Page with Stepper

The detail page opens a multi-step staic wizard in which input fields are grouped by step according to functional logic. The order of steps is defined in a fixed manner and represents the standardized create process for this business object.

<QuadrelLightbox
      src="/assets/floorplans/create/multi-stepper/uc-create-multi-stepper-02.svg"
      alt="Start Wizard"
      title="Demo-Bild"
      thumbStyle={{ width: '100%', marginTop: 8 }}
      lightboxPaddingY={72}
    />


### Cancel Dialog

When the cancel action is triggered in the wizard, a confirmation dialog is displayed, announcing that all data entered so far will be discarded. The dialog ensures that the create process is only canceled intentionally and, if confirmed, redirects back to the overview page.

<QuadrelLightbox
      src="/assets/floorplans/create/multi-stepper/uc-create-multi-stepper-03.svg"
      alt="Create default flow"
      title="Cancel Data Input"
      thumbStyle={{ width: '100%', marginTop: 8 }}
      lightboxPaddingY={72}
    />

### Validation and Progress

Before moving to the next step or performing the final submit, all mandatory fields of the current step are validated. As long as required fields are missing or invalid, the navigation (Next/Submit) remains disabled; error states are shown directly on the affected fields and make the functional validation rules visible.

<QuadrelLightbox
      src="/assets/floorplans/create/multi-stepper/uc-create-multi-stepper-04.svg"
      alt="Create default flow"
      title="Final Submit"
      thumbStyle={{ width: '100%', marginTop: 8 }}
      lightboxPaddingY={72}
    />

### Creation of the Business Object

Once all steps have been completed successfully and the final submit action is triggered, the business object is created and persisted. No partial or intermediate objects are stored beforehand; creation only happens after all required data across all steps is complete and valid.

<QuadrelLightbox
      src="/assets/floorplans/create/multi-stepper/uc-create-multi-stepper-05.svg"
      alt="Create default flow"
      title="Create Business Object"
      description="Kurzer erklärender Text zur Abbildung."
      thumbStyle={{ width: '100%', marginTop: 8 }}
      lightboxPaddingY={72}
    />

### Return to Overview Page (Success Message)

After successful creation, the application navigates back to the table overview page. The newly created object is available in the table, and a snackbar indicates the successful completion of the create process without blocking the further workflow.

<QuadrelLightbox
      src="/assets/floorplans/create/multi-stepper/uc-create-multi-stepper-06.svg"
      alt="Create default flow"
      title="Success"
      thumbStyle={{ width: '100%', marginTop: 8 }}
      lightboxPaddingY={72}
    />
