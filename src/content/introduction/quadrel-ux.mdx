# Quadrel UX-Architecture

The Quadrel UI is built as an integrated low-code design system based on a UX architecture.
Its foundation is the Quadrel Layout System (QLS), which provides essential templates to 
implement recurring processes within applications consistently and efficiently.
<br />

The templates are structured from the outside in and define the central placeholders 
through which content (patterns / components) is consistently integrated and arranged.


## QLS Overview

The Overview : Template typically represents an application's overview page.

<QuadrelLightbox
      src="/assets/introduction/qd-qls-overview.png"
      alt="QLS Overview"
      title="Template : Overview"
      thumbStyle={{ width: '100%', marginTop: 8, padding: 16 }}
      lightboxPaddingY={72}
    />

## QLS Detail

The Detail layout typically represents an application's detail page, with integrated back navigation.

<QuadrelLightbox
      src="/assets/introduction/qd-qls-detail.png"
      alt="QLS Overview"
      title="Template : Detail"
      thumbStyle={{ width: '100%', marginTop: 8, padding: 16 }}
      lightboxPaddingY={72}
    />
