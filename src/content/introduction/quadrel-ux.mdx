# Quadrel UX-Architecture

The Quadrel UI is built as an integrated low-code design system based on a UX architecture.
Its foundation is the Quadrel Layout System (QLS), which provides essential templates to 
implement recurring processes within applications consistently and efficiently.
<br />

The templates are structured from the outside in and define the central placeholders through which content (patterns / components) is consistently integrated and arranged.
